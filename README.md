# skalang

Basic scripting language, syntax looking like Javascript.

__Features__
  * Static typing
  * Object paradigm (classes, no polymorphism)
  * No "null" value
  * No uninitialized variables
  * C++ binding (not for now but incoming !)
  * No manual memory management (reference counting system), but doesn't support cyclic references
  * Only one way to do a thing (loops are only made with "for")
  * Variable-based syntax : functions are variables, import are variables, variables... are variables
